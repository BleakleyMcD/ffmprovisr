        <h3>Making ffmpeg easier</h3>
        <p>FFmpeg is a pretty powerful framework for audio-visual materials. Unfortunately, it also has a steep learning curve. This app helps users through the bash command generation process so that more people can reap the benefits of the ffmpeg library. </p>
        <p>This project is very much a work in progress. Each button displays a form to help fulfill a popular user request. To use, click on the button and fill out the form. After clicking the Generate button, a command line will appear in the box below. That line can be copied and pasted into a Terminal, with the assumption that the video file is located in the same directory that the user currently is in.</p>
